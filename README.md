# Signature Work Portfolio
This portfolio showcases three projects that I have worked on throughout my time here at the University of St.Thomas. Each project highlights a different set of skills that I learned and developed during the course.

The projects included in this portfolio range from individual creative work to learning how to collaborate as a team to build a larger scale application. Some were challenging and some where just genuinely fun to make.


## Project 1: Personal Website
My personal website is a project that I created in Web Dev using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which I previously had a small amount of experience with from other classes. Through this project, I learned about layout and usability using the Foundation CSS framework, which helped me better understand responsive grid systems and modern front end structure. 
This project reflects my ability to communicate who I am through an application. The site includes a projects section that I can update in the future as I develop new or improved work. It also includes a resume section and personal interests, allowing me to present both my academic work and personality. This project was fun to create, but it was also challenging, as it required careful consideration of audience, clarity, and presentation.

## Project 2: Cat Soundboard
The Cat Soundboard was probably my most enjoyable coding experience. I created this project during my Creative Coding class, where I learned to work with several JavaScript libraries. I chose to showcase this project because, while it is intentionally playful and somewhat goofy, it demonstrates my ability to build an interactive and creative application using JavaScript libraries.
Built with p5.js and p5.sound, this project maps keyboard inputs to sound effects and animated images, creating a playful, animated cat soundboard. I also used an external macropad to map physical key presses to the soundboard, allowing for a more interactive experience.
I really enjoyed coding this project because the course emphasized creative exploration, and many of my projects focused on cats. This project allowed me to combine creativity, interactivity, and personal interest in a way that made the development process especially fun.

## Project 3: RESTful Crime Data Server
The RESTful Crime Data Server is a backend web application developed for my Web Development course that provides structured access to St. Paul crime data through a RESTful API. Built with Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite3, the server allows clients to retrieve, add, and delete crime records using JSON-based requests.

This project emphasized teamwork and communication, as it was completed in collaboration with two classmates, Alex Wodarski and Hunter Heffernan. It was challenging to learn how to implement a RESTful API with database integration, query parameters for flexible data retrieval, and basic error handling. However I can say that I understand most of it now.
